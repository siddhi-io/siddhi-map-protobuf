Sinkmapper protobuf (Sink Mapper) This output mapper allows you to convert Events to protobuf messages before publishing them. To work with this mapper you have to add auto-generated protobuf classes to the project classpath. When you use this output mapper, you can either define stream attributes as the same names as the protobuf message attributes or you can use custom mapping to map stream definition attributes with the protobuf attributes.Please find the sample proto definition here Syntax @sink(..., @map(type= protobuf , class= STRING ) QUERY PARAMETERS Name Description Default Value Possible Data Types Optional Dynamic class This specifies the class name of the protobuf message class, If sink type is grpc then it's not necessary to provide this parameter. - STRING Yes No Examples EXAMPLE 1 @sink(type='grpc', url = 'grpc://localhost:2000/org.wso2.grpc.test.MyService/process @map(type='protobuf')) define stream BarStream (stringValue string, intValue int,longValue long,booleanValue bool,floatValue float,doubleValue double) Above definition will map BarStream values into the protobuf message type of the 'process' method in 'MyService' service EXAMPLE 2 @sink(type='grpc', url = 'grpc://localhost:2000/org.wso2.grpc.test.MyService/process @map(type='protobuf'), @payload(stringValue='a',longValue='b',intValue='c',booleanValue='d',floatValue = 'e', doubleValue = 'f'))) define stream BarStream (a string, b long, c int,d bool,e float,f double); The above definition will map BarStream values to request message type of the 'process' method in 'MyService' service. and stream values will map like this, - value of 'a' will be assign 'stringValue' variable in the message class - value of 'b' will be assign 'longValue' variable in the message class - value of 'c' will be assign 'intValue' variable in the message class - value of 'd' will be assign 'booleanValue' variable in the message class - value of 'e' will be assign 'floatValue' variable in the message class - value of 'f' will be assign 'doubleValue' variable in the message class EXAMPLE 3 @sink(type='grpc', url = 'grpc://localhost:2000/org.wso2.grpc.test.MyService/testMap' @map(type='protobuf')) define stream BarStream (stringValue string,intValue int,map object); The above definition will map BarStream values to request message type of the 'testMap' method in 'MyService' service and since there is an object data type is inthe stream(map object) , mapper will assume that 'map' is an instance of 'java.util.Map' class, otherwise it will throws and error. EXAMPLE 4 @sink(type='inMemory', topic='test01', @map(type='protobuf', class='org.wso2.grpc.test.Request')) define stream BarStream (stringValue string, intValue int,longValue long,booleanValue bool,floatValue float,doubleValue double); The above definition will map BarStream values to 'org.wso2.grpc.test.Request'protobuf class type. If sink type is not a grpc, sink is expecting to get the mapping protobuf class from the 'class' parameter in the @map extension Sourcemapper protobuf (Source Mapper) This input mapper allows you to convert protobuf messages into Events. To work with this input mapper you have to add auto-generated protobuf classes to the project classpath.
